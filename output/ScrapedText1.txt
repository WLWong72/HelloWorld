How automation
helps IT go from
putting out fires to
igniting innovation
A UiPath e-bookIT equips the business with the
transformational technologies to do
amazing new things. That’s its mission.
IT helps the business find smarter, faster,
more innovative ways of working. It helps
different departments automate the flow
of information and workflows across the
enterprise. It’s a big job.

automated, beyond python scripts and cron jobs?

IT leaders may think they’ve automated everything
they can. But have they? Automation keeps evolving
and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. In
IT’s constant rush to deploy new technology, maintain
existing tools and systems, and get users answers
and support, it can be hard to take time and apply
the same problem-solving mindset to its own work.
Shouldn’t technology also make IT’s job easier?

The answer is ‘yes.’ And here’s a quick look
at how to do it.

as much as servers

IT is finally getting the props it deserves
as a driver of enterprise strategy. And it’s
about time.

But that doesn’t mean that IT departments
give up on their commitments to serving
their internal customers. Those people still
need support. Their jobs are critical. The
longer users wait, the more frustrated they
become. And the more the business suffers.

table without compromising on its service
commitments? Automation is the answer.

Automation fuels technologies such as
chatbots that deliver answers to users’
most common questions. It enables the
self-service capabilities that help users help
themselves. And it can also help IT manage
service requests faster and make data and
applications more accessible to users.

satisfaction metrics still matter, and
automating the automatable aspects
of service can actually improve the
employee experience.

Automation can help resolve user
support issues sooner and reduce
call volumes. That means employees
—and IT teams—can focus on the work
that makes a difference.

If people didn’t realize how much businesses
depended on IT before, the pandemic made
it crystal clear. IT departments were the
reason that so many businesses could
keep the doors open during COVID —at
least metaphorically. Virtually overnight, IT
workloads soared. But sudden spikes in
demand for IT support are nothing new. Every
new employee, every new application, every
new security threat increases IT’s workload.
The demand for IT support keeps growing,
and there’s no end in sight.

Those don’t always grow at the same rate that.
So what’s the answer?

Automation can help IT scale up support capacity.
IT can automate the infrastructure and operations
processes to manage ever-growing networks, data
centers, and cloud workloads. Automation can
accelerate application management processes
and help ensure security compliance. IT can even
automate administrative processes in areas like the
procurement of hardware, software, and services.
Automation can give IT teams the capacity to drive
the business forward, not hold it back.

digital transformation

Business leaders talk a lot about digital
transformation these days. They’ll announce
how they want to take the friction out of the
customer experience. They’ll discuss how they’re
breaking down operational silos and streamlining
collaboration. They’ll outline their plans for greater
accountability and transparency.

UIPATH.COM  |  HOW AUTOMATION HELPS IT GO FROM PUTTING OUT FIRES TO IGNITING INNOVATION 9Taking those big-picture projects from the drawing
board to the real world is IT’s job. In fact, it’s IT
leaders who help define the vision in the first place.

For a growing number of organizations, automation
is the catalyst for meaningful digital transformation.
It accelerates the analysis for migration and testing
that underlies every major project. It also helps
bridge the gaps between cutting-edge technologies
with groundbreaking capabilities and the legacy
systems that businesses still rely on. And it opens
the door to using predictive artificial intelligence
and machine learning capabilities at the scale that
turbocharges innovation.

If you want to innovate, you have to automate.

the agenda for a new era of work

A lot of the tasks we used to think couldn’t
be automated now can be. And that’s also true
for IT. Like every other technology, automation
keeps evolving.

Software robots can even take on a growing
range of cognitive tasks that require judgment
and analysis. The scope of use cases keeps
expanding. So it’s only fair that IT gets to enjoy
some of the same benefits of automation that
the rest of us do. They’ve earned it.
